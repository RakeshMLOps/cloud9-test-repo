Your required deliverables and project descriptions should be officially submitted to your My Team > Submissions section of the Call for Code Global Challenge web site, but you can also optionally include them here for completeness, as it is good practice to clearly document your project in your README file. Replace the examples seen here with your own deliverable links.

Use the Use this template button to create a new version of this repository and start entering content for your own Call for Code submission project. Make sure you have registered for the 2024 Call for Code Global Challenge to access resources and full project submission instructions. Remove any "INSTRUCTIONS" sections when you are ready to submit your project.
